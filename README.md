# selenium-testNg-partII

# a new part TstNg and selenium.

I tried to do
represents an example of a maven project:

    - connected to a facebook account   
    - make tests on the current url, and the presence of the connection botton
    
so we have two java classes (LoginPage and HomePage).
a configuration file xml testng.xml which we have defined the classes and a parameter that we will retrieve in our application.
the execution of the project is done via testng.xml.
the output results can be found in:

    - videos    
   - screenshots
   - and an html file in the form of a report using the ExtentReports jar file

I tried to separate the code using base classes and utils.

let's go ;-)
